FEATURE SPEC TEMPLATE — copy to docs/features/<slug>.md. Pair with a UX spec
(templates/UX-SPEC-TEMPLATE.md) for any user-facing feature. Status uses the ladder in
docs/00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md §4. Build as a vertical slice (data → API → UI).

> endpoint with no client/UI is a horizontal layer wearing a vertical-slice label.
