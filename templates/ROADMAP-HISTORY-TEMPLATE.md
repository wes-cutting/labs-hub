ROADMAP HISTORY TEMPLATE — copy to docs/03_ROADMAP-HISTORY.md, as the append-only sibling
of docs/03_ROADMAP.md (from ROADMAP-TEMPLATE.md). K31: split out of the living plan so
re-sequencing decisions and the shipped ledger can accrete indefinitely without bloating
the small, scannable "what's next" plan. Cross-linked by id (see ROADMAP-TEMPLATE.md §3).

# Roadmap History — <Project>

| Field  | Value        |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Status | Append-only  |
| Owner  | <name>       |
| Plan   | `03_ROADMAP.md` (`DOC-ROADMAP`) — the living plan this history belongs to; make it a link once both files exist |

Never edit past entries; append a new one. This doc only grows.

## 1. Re-sequencing log

Why the order changed — this is where *decided ≠ validated* shows its work. Append an entry
whenever a spike, surprise, or new constraint moves, defers, or drops an item.

| Date | Change | Trigger (spike / surprise) | Effect on the plan |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| <YYYY-MM-DD> | … | `spikes/<id>-<slug>.md` | … |

## 2. Done / shipped

Completed items, newest first — the running record of usable increments.

| Id | Item | Shipped | Notes |
| -- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| …  | …    | <YYYY-MM-DD> | … |
