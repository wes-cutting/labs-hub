PRD TEMPLATE — copy to docs/02_PRD.md. Write it AFTER the first reality-profiling spike —
data-profiling, hardware/load-profiling, integration-behavior, or value-hypothesis,
whichever matches this project's reality (see docs/00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md §6). Status starts

## 1. Problem & why now

What problem, for whom, and why it's worth solving now. One short paragraph.

## 2. Users

Who uses this and the context they're in.

## 3. Goals

What success looks like. Keep to a handful.

## 4. Non-goals (explicit)

What this product deliberately does **not** do. This section is as important as the goals
— it's how scope stays honest.

## 5. Success metrics / value hypothesis

The measurable bet: "if we ship X, users get/do Y." **Link the spike that validated it**
(or note it's still `Proposed` pending a spike).

## 6. User journeys

The critical end-to-end flows, named (these drive the e2e tests):

1. <journey> — …
2. …

## 7. Scope (high level)

The capability areas in scope, ideally ordered by value/uncertainty for sequencing.

## 8. Risks & assumptions

Key assumptions and the spikes that (will) test them. Anything unvalidated stays a risk.

## 9. Open questions

| Question | Owner | Status |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| …        | …     | open   |
