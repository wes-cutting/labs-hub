# Documentation map

This is the authoritative map of the kit's docs: the **numbering scheme**, what each doc
is, whether it's carried as-is or filled in per project, and where each lands. Status
conventions for every doc/ADR are defined in
[`00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md`](00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md) §4.

## The numbering scheme (read this first)

- **`00`** — the read-first **process spine**. Carried as-is.
- **`01`–`07`** — the per-project **narrative**, written (mostly) in this order as the
  project takes shape. Each has a template in [`../templates/`](../templates/).
- **Unnumbered** docs (`ARCHITECTURE`, `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS`, `TESTING_STRATEGY`,
  `SECURITY`) are constant **reference** — carried as-is, true on every project.
- **Folders** (`adr/`, `features/`, `ux/`, `spikes/`, `status-reports/`) hold the
  many-per-project artifacts.

The numbers are reserved slots — don't reuse or renumber them per project; just create the
file when its stage arrives.

## The numbered narrative (00–07)

| # | Doc | What it is | Carry vs. fill-in | Template |
| - | --- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| 00 | [`00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md`](00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md) | The process spine: lifecycle, spikes, vertical slices, sequencing, working with the agent. | Carry as-is | — |
| 01 | [`01_INTAKE.md`](01_INTAKE.md) | **First thing filled in:** the captured discovery conversation — problem, users, the core bet, riskiest assumptions, first spike. Pre-PRD. | Fill in | [`DISCOVERY-GUIDE.md`](../templates/DISCOVERY-GUIDE.md) (read, not filled) |
| 02 | `02_PRD.md` | Problem, users, goals, non-goals, journeys, value hypothesis. | Fill in | [`PRD-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/PRD-TEMPLATE.md) |
| 03 | `03_ROADMAP.md` (+ sibling `03_ROADMAP-HISTORY.md`) | The living, ordered backlog of spikes and slices — the **plan of record**, sequenced by uncertainty and value. The lean living plan; its append-only re-sequencing log and done/shipped ledger live in the sibling history doc so the plan itself never bloats. | Fill in | [`ROADMAP-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/ROADMAP-TEMPLATE.md) + [`ROADMAP-HISTORY-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/ROADMAP-HISTORY-TEMPLATE.md) |
| 04 | `04_DOMAIN_MODEL.md` | The conceptual model: entities, invariants, relationships, lifecycles. Storage-neutral. | Fill in | [`DOMAIN-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/DOMAIN-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md) |
| 05 | `05_DATA_MODEL.md` | The physical model realizing the domain in the chosen datastore (per `ADR-0002`). | Fill in | [`DATA-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/DATA-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md) |
| 06 | `06_API_CONTRACT.md` | The interface contract other code depends on (REST/RPC/GraphQL/internal). | Fill in | [`API-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/API-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md) |
| 07 | `07_NFR.md` | Non-functional & operational readiness: budgets, SLOs, observability, backup/restore. | Fill in | [`NFR-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/NFR-TEMPLATE.md) |

> Order is the **default**, not a queue to march through. `01_INTAKE` and the first
> spikes always come first; `04`–`07` are written/updated as the slices that need them are
> built (docs and code change together — see below). Small projects compress or skip
> rungs — see [`00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md` §11](00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md) for how to right-size.

## Constant reference (unnumbered, carry as-is)

| Doc | What it is |
| --- | ---------- |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Module boundaries and dependency direction. Stack chosen per-project via an ADR. |
| [`ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md) | Conventions, the Definition of Done, and opt-in recommended patterns. |
| [`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) | Test layers and the gate. |
| [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) | Secrets, data handling, authn/authz, dependency scanning. |
| [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) | The deployment constraints that are nearly free at commit zero and breaking changes afterwards — API base path, deny-by-default build context, identity across restores, the demo-instance pattern. Read **before** the first deploy, not at it. The project's concrete deployment goes in `DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` (situational template, below). |
| [`KIT_FEEDBACK.md`](KIT_FEEDBACK.md) | A running log of improvements to **this baseline kit** found while building the project, for a later kit pass. Carry the stub; append as lessons surface ([`00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md`](00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md) §9). |

## Per-project folders

| Folder | Holds | Template |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| [`adr/`](adr/) | One ADR per real decision (stack, datastore, cross-cutting). The meta doc explains the format. | [`ADR-TEMPLATE.md`](adr/ADR-TEMPLATE.md) |
| `features/` | One feature spec per feature. | [`FEATURE-SPEC-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/FEATURE-SPEC-TEMPLATE.md) |
| `ux/` | One UX spec per user-facing capability (flows + screen states). | [`UX-SPEC-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/UX-SPEC-TEMPLATE.md) |
| `spikes/` | One report per investigation (**these come first**). | [`SPIKE-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/SPIKE-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md) |
| `status-reports/` | Periodic snapshots for clean hand-offs between sessions. | [`STATUS-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/STATUS-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md) |
| `reviews/` | Point-in-time reviews and living initiatives — a doc-type taxonomy, not a single genre (see below). | — |

`reviews/` doc-type taxonomy (tag each doc's frontmatter `type` — see §4 in
[`00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md`](00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md)):

| Type | Lifecycle | What it is |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- |
| `audit` | Frozen snapshot | Point-in-time, repo-wide findings (a security/architecture review). Never edited after landing — a follow-up is a new doc. |
| `initiative` | Living | A multi-item body of work that spawns roadmap items (e.g. a restructure brief); updated as it progresses. |
| `working-note` | Living, often disposable | Scratch analysis for a specific effort; promote anything durable out of it, don't let it become a second source of truth. |
| `generated` | Regenerated, never hand-edited | Produced by tooling from other docs (e.g. a docs crosswalk) — hand-editing it is immediately overwritten. |

## Situational templates

Copied only when a specific kind of work comes up, not per numbered doc:

| Template | When |
| -------- | ---- |
| [`README-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/README-TEMPLATE.md) | The first docs round → the repo's own `README.md`. See "The repo front page" below — this one has a **rename** step attached to it. |
| [`SCHEMA-MAP-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/SCHEMA-MAP-TEMPLATE.md) | A bulk import/ETL will be prepared by an agent or person without repo access (see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)'s ETL-artifact split). |
| [`DEPLOY-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/DEPLOY-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md) | The project is about to be deployed somewhere real → `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md`. Read [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) first — two of its rules are breaking changes once anything has shipped. |

## How a project starts

Pair with the agent to run **discovery**, guided by
[`../templates/DISCOVERY-GUIDE.md`](../templates/DISCOVERY-GUIDE.md) (a read-only playbook);
capture it in [`01_INTAKE.md`](01_INTAKE.md). The intake names the first **spike**; the
spike de-risks the bet; *then* the PRD and the rest of the narrative get written.

## The repo front page

A fresh copy of the kit arrives with a root `README.md` describing **the kit**. That is
correct for the kit's own repo and wrong for yours the moment a project starts — leave it
and the repo's front page advertises the starter kit indefinitely, while the kit's overview
and the project's overview fight over one file.

**In the first docs round, hand the front page over to the project:**

1. `git mv README.md KIT-README.md` — the kit's overview keeps its content and its links,
   just not the front page.
2. Copy [`../templates/README-TEMPLATE.md`](../templates/README-TEMPLATE.md) to `README.md`
   and fill it in: name, one-liner, status, the stack per `ADR-0001`, links into `docs/`,
   and a pointer to the newest status report.

From then on the project README is **living** — update its Status section in the same change
as each status report, the same way any other doc moves with the code
([`00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md` §9](00_WAYS_OF_WORKING.md)).

> Keep docs and code in sync **in the same change**. A change to data shape, interface, or
> architecture updates the corresponding doc in the same commit.
